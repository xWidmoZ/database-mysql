~QUESTIONS:
1. How do you have your own mysql database?
- You will receive a free database on the RemoteMysql.com website which I heartily recommend, easy to use, everyone will catch what and how.
2. Where to enter database data in the code?
- Enter the data in the 25th line of the @host@ code Change to remotemysql.com, @BASE-NAME@ to the name of your database, etc.

To create a connection to the database you need to implement a void
in the main classroom when running the plugin:
MysqlBase.getDb().openConnection();

Then you can create a table with the void execute (value);
example:
MysqlBase.getDb().execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` dbUsers` (NAME varchar (16) not null, money int no null, primary key (NAME));");
